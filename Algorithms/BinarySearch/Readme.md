Real-Life Scenario
In a flight booking system, users often need to search for flights based on destination and departure time. The flights can be stored in a 2D array where each row represents flights to a specific destination, and within each row, flights are sorted by departure time.

The goal is to quickly find a flight with the closest departure time to the user's desired time.
